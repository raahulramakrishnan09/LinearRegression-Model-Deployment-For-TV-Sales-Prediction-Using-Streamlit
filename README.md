# Linear Regression Model Deployment Using Streamlit for TV Sales Prediction
This repository demonstrates how to deploy a Linear Regression algorithm model using Streamlit for predicting sales based on advertising budget.
## What is Streamlit?

Streamlit lets you transform Python scripts into interactive web apps in minutes, instead of weeks. Build dashboards, generate reports, or create chat apps. Once youâ€™ve created an app, you can use our [Community Cloud platform](https://streamlit.io/cloud) to deploy, manage, and share your app.

### Why choose Streamlit?

- **Simple and Pythonic:** Write beautiful, easy-to-read code.
- **Fast, interactive prototyping:** Let others interact with your data and provide feedback quickly.
- **Live editing:** See your app update instantly as you edit your script.
- **Open-source and free:** Join a vibrant community and contribute to Streamlit's future.

## Streamlit Installation

Installs Streamlit, a Python library for creating web apps:

```python
!pip install streamlit -q
```

You're all set! If not, head over to [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started) for specific installs.


## Fetch Public IP Address
Retrieves your public IPv4 address using a web service:
```python
!wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
```
## Writing to code.py
Creates or overwrites code.py with the subsequent commands:
```python
%%writefile code.py
```

## Install localtunnel:
This line uses npm to install localtunnel, which is used for exposing local servers to the internet:
```python
!npm install localtunnel
```
##Localtunnel Setup:
Installs localtunnel, starts the Streamlit app (code.py), and sets up a tunnel to expose it publicly:
```python
!streamlit run code.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
```

# Files:
### model.joblib:
joblilb formatted machine learning model trained on the TV marketing dataset.

### code.py:
Python script containing streamlit web application code for model deployment.
```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import joblib
#load data
df=pd.read_csv('/content/tvmarketing.csv')

# Model training
model = joblib.load('/content/model.joblib')

st.title('Sales Prediction')
st.markdown('Enter the TV advertising budget to predict sales:')

tv_budget = st.number_input('TV Advertising Budget', min_value=0.0)

if st.button('Predict'):
    predicted_sales = model.predict([[tv_budget]])
    st.write(f'Predicted Sales: {predicted_sales[0]:.2f}')
```
